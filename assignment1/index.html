    <h4>
      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The use of animations and scrolling is so well thought-out and meaningful!
      It corresponds with the themes, unfolding in the website, adds visual
      interest while also helping to segment parts clearly.

        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Cursor lingered a little longer on the front page, and the architect’s
          thoughts began to pop up in text form and follow cursor movements.
          Mimicks conductor hand movements, a very delightful feature. However,
          readability is compromised as the paragraphs can get longer than the
          cursor line of motion can accommodate, and you start having to read
          backwards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hovered over the elements, and they shift around in perspective,
          overlapping in some areas spatially, creating a 3-dimensionality to
          the otherwise 2-dimensional sketch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scrolled and the flat colors transitioned to the colourful images +
          videos in between. This follows through from a previous drone shot, to
          the sketch, to the starting of the video sections’ draft concert hall
          shape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hovered over title fonts and they expand to “Fill” the space, just as
          sound would in a space. Adds to the sound narrative and strengthens
          the cohesive design of the website!
        </li>
        <li>
          Interacted with the informational tags on the sides of segments, such
          as the “sound on” tag to reveal which musical piece was being played,
          and the “Explore Model” tag. Tags are subtle yet informative, guiding
          users on how to interact with the website, without obstructing the
          beauty of the website spreads. An interesting yet perceptive choice to
          make them a different font from the title/body texts, which by right
          is a graphic design faux pas, but it actually improves signposting for
          the viewer because they know that all text in that font is
          “informational” like a control panel, that they can reliably fall back
          for navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicked and dragged the mouse to move the 3D model around in space,
          observed the well-rendered textures and angles. Clicked on the
          information points located on the model to get additional information
          on it.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>
      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The 3D models! I loved looking at the materiality of the models, and could
      appreciate the structures from every side. This mimicked holding the
      models in ones hands, an excellent interactive feature placed into the
      website for an immersive and elevated experience!
    </p>
    <p>
      The front page, and typically at every intersection from intro text to the
      interview screens. I loved looking at the subtle change in illustration
      perspective with my mouse hover, as well as how the words swelled to fill
      the space with my mouse+scroll movements. With the intersections, I could
      hear the dipping in + out of the music, and see the match-cuts of sketch,
      to final architecture, to the draft stage models that would bring me to
      the interview process. It helped me appreciate the work so much more, and
      is a delightful way of segmenting areas. As a designer, such
      considerations in detail fascinate me, and adds to the overall
      cohesiveness of the narrative, that I would seek to emulate.
    </p>

    <h4>
      4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Scrolling back and forth to see how the transition of elements interact
      with each other! Beautiful, thoughtful and fascinating to watch, while not
      detracting from the flow of the work but adding interest and
      categorization!
    </p>

    <h4>
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is a portfolio case study for the Walt Disney Concert Hall, to show the
      process from conception to execution of the design of the structure. It is
      both a showcase work for the public (arranged in a digestible, interactive
      and engaging way), as well as a good demonstration of the architects’
      abilities for potential future collaborators.
    </p>

    <h4>
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Demonstrates in a variety of ways the thought and effort placed: each part
      of the process is segmented into its own thematic section, and a feature
      collection of video interviews collecting the thought processes of the
      architects from their mouths (like a biography). In these, sketches of the
      work, models and photos of the structures were showcased in various ways:
      2D sketches, still images, drone shots for good shots of all angles,
      images of the work-in-progress, 3D renderings of the structural drafts of
      the hall, colour scheme descriptions.
    </p>

    <h4>
      7.What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h4>
    <p>
      Once over slowly, maximum twice. I feel like you can go through it once if
      it is done very slowly: it is much like a virtual gallery exhibition, to
      be walked through and absorbed. If you scroll through quickly, you’ll miss
      the magic of the details. Second round could be to better appreciate the
      parts missed out, but beyond that the magic may be lost.
    </p>

    <h4>
      8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h4>
    <p>
      While scrolling, elements move by expanding, animating, or contracting to
      indicate progression. These elements stop their movement when scrolling
      stops, like a stop-motion movie caught in a still frame. When one element
      expands exponentially when scrolled to, you would know it has entered the
      next section. An example is that the pages peek into the next sections
      when it is nearing the end of the existing one. This is good, so that the
      viewer is aware of how the information is categorized, which is good for
      clarity of points.
    </p>

    <h4>
      9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h4>
    <p>
      It mimics a gallery exhibition walk-through experience, and the pace
      emulates it as well!
    </p>

    <h4>
      10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Absorb slowly, appreciate every detail, interact with every section, as
      you would in a well thought-out space that invites you into the process of
      everything.
    </p>

    <h4>
      11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h4>
    <p>Awe, fascination, appreciation, inquisitive curiosity!</p>

    <h4>
      12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Trying to read the title words and the starting moving letters. Styling
      sacrificed legibility unfortunately in some instances. Furthermore at
      times, the next section scrolled too rapidly into frame, making it a
      little disorienting for the viewer.
    </p>

    <h4>
      13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </h4>
    <p>
      When I am going to be frustrated about specific parts of the process, a
      helpful guide/point is put in! For example: There are markers to say “you
      are leaving interactive section III”, there are sections of the video,
      there is freezing of frame for the bg so it isn’t distracting to the text,
      there is subtitles for the interview! If you want to know what song is
      being played in the background, just hover to the “Sound On” section at
      the top of the screen, and it shows up!
