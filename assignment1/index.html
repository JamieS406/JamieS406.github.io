      The use of animations and scrolling is so well thought-out and meaningful!
      It corresponds with the themes unfolding in the website, adds visual

              The architect’s thoughts appeared in text follow cursor movements,
              like a conductor's gestures. This ties in well with the "Concert
              Hall" topical theme. However, readability is compromised as the
              paragraphs can get longer than the cursor line of motion can
              accommodate, and you start having to read backwards.

              Interacted with tags on the sides of segments, such as the “Sound
              On” tag to reveal which musical piece was being played, and the
              “Explore Model” tag. Tags are subtle yet informative, guiding
              without obstructing the beauty of the website spreads.
            </li>
            <li class="lopacwhite">
              A perceptive choice to make information tags a different font from
              the title/body texts. By right a graphic design faux pas, it
              actually improves signposting for the viewer: text in that font
              can reliably be fallen back on for navigation.

        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?

    </div>
    <p>
      The 3D models! I loved looking at the materiality of the models, and could
      appreciate the structures from every side. This mimicked holding the
      models in ones hands, an excellent interactive feature placed into the
      website for an immersive and elevated experience!
    </p>
    <p>
      The front page, and typically at every intersection from intro text to the
      interview screens. I loved looking at the subtle change in illustration
      perspective with my mouse hover, as well as how the words swelled to fill
      the space with my mouse+scroll movements. With the intersections, I could
      hear the dipping in + out of the music, and see the match-cuts of sketch,
      to final architecture, to the draft stage models that would bring me to
      the interview process. It helped me appreciate the work so much more, and
      is a delightful way of segmenting areas, and adds to the overall
      cohesiveness of the narrative.

          It is a portfolio case study for the Walt Disney Concert Hall, to show
          the process from conception to execution of the design of the
          structure. It is both a showcase work for the public (arranged in a
          digestible, interactive and engaging way), as well as a good
          demonstration of the architects’ abilities for potential future
          collaborators.

        <p id="q6_para">
          Each part of the process is segmented into its own thematic
          section,with video interviews showing the thought processes of the
          designers like a biography. Many different mediums of progress are
          shown: 2D sketches, still images, drone shots from all angles, images
          of the work-in-progress, 3D renderings of the structural drafts of the
          hall, and colour scheme descriptions.

        <p id="q7_para">
          Once over slowly, maximum twice. I feel like you can go through it
          once if it is done very slowly: it is much like a virtual gallery
          exhibition, to be walked through and absorbed. If you scroll through
          quickly, you’ll miss the magic of the details. Second round could be
          to better appreciate the parts missed out, but beyond that the magic
          may be lost.

      </h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      While scrolling, elements move by expanding, animating, or contracting to
      indicate progression. These elements stop their movement when scrolling
      stops, like a stop-motion movie caught in a still frame. When one element
      expands exponentially when scrolled to, you would know it has entered the
      next section. An example is that the pages peek into the next sections
      when it is nearing the end of the existing one. This is good, so that the
      viewer is aware of how the information is categorized, which is good for
      clarity of points.

      It mimics a gallery exhibition walk-through experience, and the pace
      emulates it as well!

    <h4>
      10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Absorb slowly, appreciate every detail, interact with every section, as
      you would in a well thought-out space that invites you into the process of
      everything.
    </p>

    <h4>
      11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h4>
    <p>Awe, fascination, appreciation, inquisitive curiosity!</p>

    <h4>
      12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Trying to read the title words and the starting moving letters. Styling
      sacrificed legibility unfortunately in some instances. Furthermore at
      times, the next section scrolled too rapidly into frame, making it a
      little disorienting for the viewer.
    </p>

    <h4>
      13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </h4>
    <p>
      When I am going to be frustrated about specific parts of the process, a
      helpful guide/point is put in! For example: There are markers to say “you
      are leaving interactive section III”, there are sections of the video,
      there is freezing of frame for the bg so it isn’t distracting to the text,
      there is subtitles for the interview! If you want to know what song is
      being played in the background, just hover to the “Sound On” section at
      the top of the screen, and it shows up!
