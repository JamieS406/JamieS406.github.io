    <h4>
      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The use of animations and scrolling is so well thought-out and meaningful!
      It corresponds with the themes, unfolding in the website, adds visual
      interest while also helping to segment parts clearly.
    </p>

    <section class="box">
      <h4 id="para-2">
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cursor lingered a little longer on the front page, and the architect’s
          thoughts began to pop up in text form and follow cursor movements.
          Mimicks conductor hand movements, a very delightful feature. However,
          readability is compromised as the paragraphs can get longer than the
          cursor line of motion can accommodate, and you start having to read
          backwards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hovered over the elements, and they shift around in perspective,
          overlapping in some areas spatially, creating a 3-dimensionality to
          the otherwise 2-dimensional sketch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scrolled and the flat colors transitioned to the colourful images +
          videos in between. This follows through from a previous drone shot, to
          the sketch, to the starting of the video sections’ draft concert hall
          shape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hovered over title fonts and they expand to “Fill” the space, just as
          sound would in a space. Adds to the sound narrative and strengthens
          the cohesive design of the website!
        </li>
        <li>
          Interacted with the informational tags on the sides of segments, such
          as the “sound on” tag to reveal which musical piece was being played,
          and the “Explore Model” tag. Tags are subtle yet informative, guiding
          users on how to interact with the website, without obstructing the
          beauty of the website spreads. An interesting yet perceptive choice to
          make them a different font from the title/body texts, which by right
          is a graphic design faux pas, but it actually improves signposting for
          the viewer because they know that all text in that font is
          “informational” like a control panel, that they can reliably fall back
          for navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicked and dragged the mouse to move the 3D model around in space,
          observed the well-rendered textures and angles. Clicked on the
          information points located on the model to get additional information
          on it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h4>
      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The 3D models! I loved looking at the materiality of the models, and could
      appreciate the structures from every side. This mimicked holding the
      models in ones hands, an excellent interactive feature placed into the
      website for an immersive and elevated experience!
